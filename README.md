# AOLer

A BZFlag plug-in that will convert messages into a universal language for all to understand: AOL 1337 Speak.

## Requirements

- BZFlag 2.4.0+
- C++11

## What does this plug-in do?

Any chat message that is sent in-game must be given to the server first and the server is allowed to manipulate the contents of the message or reject it entirely. That's how swear filters work in servers.

**Original Message**

```
What is happening to the chat?
```

**Translated Message**

```
